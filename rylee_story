A Story
Lisieux glided across the ice, the sound of xyr blades echoing in the empty rink. Pushing forward, xe leaned into a spiral, reaching up with xyr arms in a silent appeal. The dim rink lighting remained a steady warm yellow as xyr body spilled through the remaining elements in xyr program, the longing and grief almost tangible in the chilled air. The silence rang loudly as xe struck the final pose, breathing heavily. Planting xyr hands on xyr knees, Lisieux leaned over to catch xyr breath. Pushing sweaty strands of hair off xyr face, chest heaving as xe swung into a cooldown lap, xe began to mentally review the program. It was brand new, self-choreographed for the upcoming season. The theme was “yearning,” and xe had tried to make every spin, every step sequence, every jump scream xyr longing. Lisieux had told xyr coach that the theme was about xyr desire to get better, to improve xyr skating, to win. 
A sudden bout of coughing shook xem from xyr thoughts, and xe bent double as the hacking coughs tore from xyr lungs. It was getting worse. Xe coughed again, trying to dislodge the scratch from the back of xyr throat. There was a tickle there, as if something had lodged in xyr lungs and was trying to come out. Stepping off the ice, Lisieux swallowed hard, determined to keep whatever was there in place. Xe couldn’t afford any interruptions in xyr training, especially not illness. The first qualifying competition was only two months away. There was so much xyr still had to do.

“Again!”
